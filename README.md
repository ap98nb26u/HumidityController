# What is this

This is a program for the humidity control device I use at home.

# Motivation

I've had a simple dehumidifier for some time, but when I bought a humidifier during the dry season last winter, I also considered a more sophisticated dehumidifier.
However, I did not purchase any of the products I investigated because the humidity control range was too wide, ranging from 40% to 60%.
Instead, I decided to add a single-function humidifier and control them with a microcomputer.
